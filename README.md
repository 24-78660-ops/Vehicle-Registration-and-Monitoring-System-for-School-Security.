# Vehicle-Registration-and-Monitoring-System-for-School-Security.

The Vehicle Registration and Monitoring System for School Security is a computer-based solution designed to help the school manage and monitor all vehicles entering and leaving the campus. Manual record keeping at the school gate often results in errors, delays, and lost information. This system stores vehicle and owner information digitally, making registration and monitoring faster, more secure, and easier to access. It will be developed using Python and will follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
